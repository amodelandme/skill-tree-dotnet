## Tech Currency Rule

> **This rule is non-negotiable. It applies to every skill that reads this file.**

AI training data is stale. For .NET and C# this matters — the ecosystem ships
on an annual cadence and breaking changes between minor versions are common.
FluentValidation v11 → v12 removed `.Transform()`. EF Core 9 → 10 changed
interceptor registration. C# 13 → 14 introduced new syntax that older patterns
contradict. Training data cannot keep up.

**Before any skill includes a version-specific claim — a package name, a version
number, an API shape, a C# language feature, an ASP.NET Core behavior — it must:**

1. **Doubt** — assume training knowledge is wrong for anything version-specific
2. **Verify** — search `learn.microsoft.com` or the package's official NuGet/GitHub
   page to confirm the claim applies to the pinned versions below
3. **Reference** — include the source URL alongside the claim in the artifact

**If a skill cannot verify a claim: flag it explicitly for human review.
Never guess. Never assert from training alone. "I need to verify this" is
always the correct answer when verification is not possible in the current session.**

Mnemonic: **DVR — Doubt, Verify, Reference.** Same order every time.

## Pinned Stack Versions

> These are the authoritative versions for this project. Any skill making a
> technology-specific recommendation must verify against these versions before
> including the recommendation in any artifact.

| Technology       | Pinned version | Verification source |
|---|---|---|
| .NET             | 10             | learn.microsoft.com/dotnet |
| C#               | 14             | learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp |
| ASP.NET Core     | 10             | learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core |
| EF Core          | 10             | learn.microsoft.com/ef/core |
| xUnit            | verify always  | xunit.net / NuGet |
| FluentValidation | verify always  | docs.fluentvalidation.net / NuGet |
| Moq              | verify always  | github.com/devlooped/moq / NuGet |

> Entries marked `verify always` change frequently enough that no pinned value
> is safe to trust. Look them up at the start of any session that touches them.

## Architecture Rules

These are non-negotiable. Deviating from any of these requires an ADR.

- **Dependency direction is inward toward Domain.** Domain references nothing outside
  itself. Application references Domain. Infrastructure references Domain.
  Api references Application. This is enforced at the project reference level —
  if a build succeeds with a backward reference, the project structure is wrong.

- **The Application layer owns use case orchestration.** No business logic in controllers.
  No business logic in Infrastructure. If a decision is made, it is made in
  Application or Domain.

- **The service interface is the DTO boundary.** Domain entities must never appear in
  any `I<Feature>Service` method signature. DTOs flow inward across the boundary.
  Entities never flow outward. DTO-to-entity mapping happens inside the service.

- **All domain mutations go through controlled methods.** No public setters on domain
  entities. Invariants are the entity's responsibility, not the caller's.

- **Infrastructure is a plugin.** All persistence and external service access is behind
  interfaces defined in Domain or Application. Infrastructure implements them.
  No `DbContext` references in Application or Domain.

---

## Layer Boundaries

```
Api             → Application (via I<Feature>Service interfaces)
Application     → Domain     (entities, value objects, domain interfaces)
Infrastructure  → Domain     (implements repository and external service interfaces)
Domain          → (nothing)
```

**What each layer owns:**

| Layer | Owns | Never owns |
|---|---|---|
| Api | HTTP concerns, request/response DTOs, input validation | Business logic, domain entities, persistence |
| Application | Use case orchestration, DTO ↔ entity mapping, sanitization | HTTP concerns, EF Core, external HTTP clients |
| Domain | Business rules, entities, value objects, domain exceptions, repository interfaces | Framework dependencies (see Tech Stack Quirks for deliberate exceptions) |
| Infrastructure | EF Core DbContext, repository implementations, external service clients | Business logic, HTTP request handling |

---

## Conventions and Patterns

### Naming

| Pattern | Example | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `I<Entity>Repository` | `IOrderRepository` | Persistence interfaces — defined in Domain |
| `I<Feature>Service` | `IOrderService` | Application service interfaces — defined in Application |
| `<Entity>Response` | `OrderResponse` | Read DTOs returned to callers |
| `Create<Entity>Request` | `CreateOrderRequest` | Write DTOs for creation |
| `Update<Entity>Request` | `UpdateOrderRequest` | Write DTOs for updates |
| `<Feature>Exception` | `OrderNotFoundException` | Domain exceptions — carry `StatusCode` |

### Exception Handling

- Domain exceptions extend a `<ProjectName>Exception` abstract base class that carries
  an `int StatusCode` property.
- A single `GlobalExceptionMiddleware` maps domain exceptions to `ProblemDetails`
  responses using that status code.
- **Controllers contain only the happy path.** Zero `try/catch` blocks in any controller.
- All error responses use `Content-Type: application/problem+json` (RFC 9457 §8.1).
- The 500 response `detail` field must never include exception message text —
  information disclosure risk.

### Validation

- Validation runs at the HTTP boundary, inside the controller, before any service code
  executes. Invalid requests return `400` before the service is called.
- [Document your chosen validation library and registration pattern here.]
- [Document any sanitization convention — where it runs and what it covers.]

### Dependency Injection Lifetimes

| Component type | Lifetime | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Scoped services (stateful per-request) | Scoped | Default for application services, repositories |
| Stateless strategy/evaluator components | Singleton | Safe to share — no mutable state |
| Validators | Scoped | Injected into controllers — must match controller lifetime |

---

## What Not To Do

> This section encodes hard-won conventions. Treat each item as a constraint,
> not a suggestion.

- **Do not add business logic to controllers.** Controllers make HTTP decisions.
  Application services make business decisions.

- **Do not expose domain entities through the service interface.** Map to DTOs
  inside the service. The controller layer must never call `.ToResponse()` or
  similar mapping methods directly.

- **Do not add public setters to domain entities.** All mutations go through
  explicit domain methods. If a property needs to change, there is a method for it.

- **Do not reference `DbContext` outside of Infrastructure.** Repository interfaces
  are defined in Domain. Their EF Core implementations live in Infrastructure.
  Nothing else touches EF Core.

- **Do not add `try/catch` to controllers.** `GlobalExceptionMiddleware` handles
  all exceptions. Controllers contain only the happy path.

- **Do not use raw SQL with string concatenation.** Parameterized queries only.
  `FromSqlRaw()` with interpolated or concatenated strings is prohibited.

- **[Add project-specific items here — deprecated packages, config values that
  must not change, naming pitfalls, patterns that were tried and rejected.]**

## Tech Stack Quirks

> Document surprises, deprecated API choices, and non-obvious decisions here.
> Each entry should explain what, why, and what to do instead (if applicable).
> This prevents the same mistake from being made twice.

### Template entry format:

**[Package or technology] — [brief title]**
> [What is non-obvious or surprising. What the correct approach is.
> Why the incorrect approach might look tempting. When this matters.]

---

### Example entries (replace with your own):

**FluentValidation — no `.Transform()` in v12**
> `.Transform()` was removed in FluentValidation v12. Use `.Must()` lambdas for
> rules that require a transformed value for comparison. Note: `.Must()` validates
> the cleaned value but does not mutate the DTO — sanitization must be applied
> separately in the service layer if the clean value is what you intend to persist.

**[FrameworkReference on Domain]**
> `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` is referenced by `<ProjectName>.Domain.csproj` to
> enable `StatusCodes` constants on domain exception subclasses. This is a deliberate
> tradeoff: the named constants (`Status404NotFound`, `Status409Conflict`) carry
> semantic meaning that magic numbers do not. Scope is limited to exception classes only.
> Do not introduce additional ASP.NET Core dependencies into Domain without an ADR.

**[Connection string / environment variable]**
> `[Config key]` is set to `[value]` intentionally. Do not change this without
> understanding [the dependency it satisfies]. It affects [what].

---

## Testing Conventions

- Unit tests live in `<ProjectName>.Tests/Unit/` and are decorated
  `[Trait("Category", "Unit")]`.
- Integration tests live in `<ProjectName>.Tests/Integration/` and are decorated
  `[Trait("Category", "Integration")]`.
- CI runs `dotnet test --filter "Category!=Integration"` — integration tests require
  a running [database / external service] and are a separate gate.
- [Document your test naming convention here — e.g., `MethodName_StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehavior`.]
- [Document any shared fixtures, base classes, or test helpers that exist.]
- Mock the interfaces defined in Domain (`IRepository`, `IService`), not the
  concrete implementations. This keeps tests resilient to infrastructure changes.

## Current Constraints

> These are known limitations that are intentionally deferred to a future phase.
> Do not work around them — work within them until the phase that addresses them.

| Constraint | Deferred To | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| No authentication or authorization | Phase [X] | Do not build features that assume caller identity |
| No caching layer | Phase [X] | Do not optimize for DB hit frequency prematurely |
| No rate limiting | Phase [X] | Depends on authentication from Phase [X] |
| [Add constraints here] | | |

## Before You Change Anything

1. Read [`docs/architecture.md`](architecture.md) — understand the layer structure,
   request flows, and design tradeoffs.
2. Read [`docs/current-state.md`](current-state.md) — know what phase is active,
   what is in progress, and what the current guardrails are.
3. Read the relevant `docs/decisions/<feature>/spec.md` if working on a defined feature.
4. Check the [Known Issues](current-state.md#known-issues) section for anything that
   intersects with your work.
5. Run the build and full test suite before making changes. Establish a clean baseline.
6. If your change affects a layer boundary, a domain invariant, or the security model —
   discuss it before implementing. These are architectural decisions.
7. **Apply the DVR rule** — before recommending any package, API, or language feature,
   verify it against the pinned stack versions above. Do not proceed on training
   knowledge alone for anything version-specific.
